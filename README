Project 1 
CS 4760 - OS

To run the project you first have to compile it. 
Type 'make' into the console and make sure you are in the correct directory.
you will get a ass1 executable. ./ass1 to run it with no arguments
The 3 arguments ass1 takes are:
-h for help and it prints to screen the other arguments
-p for testing out perror
-n and to take in a variable x for later 

to clean to the file type 'make clean' it will remove the ass1 exe from the directory


// Notes:
Parts of this project were kind of confusing. Part 5 was the most confusing because some questions were 
not questions and just statments. Which made me think what was wanted of me to do. Also to me not a lot of changed
in some of the test runs.
